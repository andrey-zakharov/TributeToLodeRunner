### Secret Technique : Technique to raise guards or Guards elevator

This is also a phenomenon that you sometimes see when playing a normal side, but if you try to use it intentionally, you can use it.

If you break down two or more blocks and bury the sentry in the lower block, the sentry will climb up and "fall" to the upper block. 
If the upper block is already buried, you can lift it by breaking it down. 
If you pay attention to the timing of breaking blocks and use them wisely, you can raise guards from deep floors.

This side is a series of secret tricks, "the technique of pulling up the guard" + "passing over the head of the guard from the right side and breaking the bricks in the air in the next space".
