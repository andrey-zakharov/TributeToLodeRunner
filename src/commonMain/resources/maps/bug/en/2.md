### Strange Phenomenon: Guard's Egg
*Source: Roadrunner Fan Club Bulletin Vol.2*
 1) Kill the Guard
 2) Characters appear when guards appear, but guards cannot appear
 3) Both players and guards can pass over this character.

Kill only one guard (just dig 5 holes right after the start), and let the surviving guard pass over the egg, leaving 
green garbage behind. In the 88 version, more bizarre phenomena occurred due to the palette, but in the 98/X68000 version, 
it is not so good.
