### Strange Phenomenon: Sucking into a pitfall 
*Source: Roadrunner Fan Club Bulletin Vol.3*

This is a phenomenon that you often see even when playing normal sides. 
If the player touches the trap with the sentinel on it from the side, it will run into it. 
You can observe this plane by keeping right and keep going (This plane cannot be cleared). 
Naturally, the player dies by contacting the sentinel. It's a strange death.
