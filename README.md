# [Tribute to Lode Runner](https://tributetoloderunner.github.io/)

https://tributetoloderunner.github.io/

There are levels 28-tiles wide, and 26-tiles wide. Here included both sets from different platforms and releases.
Not almost, but some based on two amazing projects: 
 - https://github.com/lvcabral/Lode-Runner-Roku
 - https://github.com/SimonHung/LodeRunner_TotalRecall

Added:
 - reworked actor's logic to SFM
 - IBM, NEC and NES tileset.

Plans:
 - Dialogs
 - NTSC emulation shader (for IBM and NEC tilesets presumably)
 - Stereo sound
 - virtual keys (touch support)
 - complete WFC generation
 - editor and sharing & importing levels in URL
 - precise to original AI?
 - animate tiles in level to support NES style completely

### Original story
You are a highly trained Galactic Commando deep in enemy territory.

Greedy leaders of the Bungeling Empire have stolen a fortune in gold from the peace-loving people, 
but you've just discovered their secret underground treasury. You will be running, jumping, drilling passages, 
and outfoxing life-threatening guards as you try to recover every last ingot of Bungeling booty. 

Lode Runner is a one-of-a-kind game that offers you truly unlimited game play. You'll never run short of challenge.

For starters, Lode Runner serves up 150 game screens, each with its own unique puzzles and challenges.

Each of the 150 different levels requires strategic problem solving and quick thinking in addition to lightning-fast reflexes.

But that's just half of the story! Lode Runner is also a powerful, easy to-use game generator that lets you design your very own Lode Runner games. Without any knowledge of programming, you can easily design and save to disk your own unique Lode Runner game screens and bring
them to action-packed, animated life. 

Lode Runner: The ultimate strategy game for arcade enthusiasts.
